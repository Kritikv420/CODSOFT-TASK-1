This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.  
The dataset is provided by **Kaggle** and is widely used for ML beginners.
Project Overview
- Performed **data cleaning** (handling missing values, encoding categorical data).  
- Engineered new features like family size and title extraction.  
- Built models to classify survival chances.  
- Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
